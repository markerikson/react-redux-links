# React/Redux Links
Curated tutorial and resource links I've collected on React, Redux, ES6, and more, meant to be a collection of high-quality articles and resources for someone who wants to learn about the React-Redux ecosystem.  Not quite "awesome", but hopefully useful as a starting point I can give to others.  Suggestions welcome.

Another important resource is the Reactiflux community on Discord, which has chat channels dedicated to discussion of React, Redux, and other related technologies.  There's always a number of people hanging out and answering questions, and it's a great place to ask questions and learn.  The invite link is at https://www.reactiflux.com.

You might also want to check out my categorized list of Redux-related addons, libraries, and utilities, at [Redux Ecosystem Links](https://github.com/markerikson/redux-ecosystem-links).  Other useful resource lists include [Awesome React](https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react), [Awesome React Native](https://github.com/jondot/awesome-react-native), and [Awesome Redux](https://github.com/xgrommx/awesome-redux).
