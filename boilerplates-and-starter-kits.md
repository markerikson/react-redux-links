### Boilerplates and Starter Kits


#### Suggested Starter Kits for Learners

**NOTE**: It's easy for someone new to the React/Redux ecosystem to get confused by some of these boilerplates and starter kits.  Many of them include dozens of specifically-configured libraries, and it can be hard for a learner to understand how all the pieces fit together.  If you're trying to learn React or Redux for the first time, it's suggested that you start with reading tutorials and articles first, until you have a reasonable understanding of how things work.  However, if you _do_ want to use a starter kit as a learning tool, I specifically suggest the ones in this section.  They are simpler, easier to understand, and well documented.

- **Simple Redux Boilerplate**  
  https://github.com/tsaiDavid/simple-redux-boilerplate  
  Excellent example.  Includes enough to be useful, but not too many dependencies so it's confusing.
  
- **Web-App**  
  https://github.com/cesarandreu/web-app  
  Another very good learning resource.  Heavily commented Webpack config, good default settings.
