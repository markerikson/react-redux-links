### Boilerplates and Starter Kits

- **React Starter Project Search Tool**  
  http://andrewhfarmer.com/starter-project/  
  Search for starter kits with/without specific libraries and sort by GitHub stars, number of dependencies, or recently updated.

- **React-Redux Universal Hot Example**  
  https://github.com/erikras/react-redux-universal-hot-example  
  Has the kitchen sink, and more.  Popular, but maybe too many things stuffed into one repo.
  
- **React-Redux Starter Kit**  
  https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit  
  Very widely recommended.  Well laid out, good documentation.  Definitely worth looking at.  v0.18 uses Babel 5, v1.0 uses Babel 6.
  
- **Simple Redux Boilerplate**  
  https://github.com/tsaiDavid/simple-redux-boilerplate  
  Excellent example.  Includes enough to be useful, but not too many dependencies so it's confusing.
  
- **Web-App**  
  https://github.com/cesarandreu/web-app  
  Another very good learning resource.  Heavily commented Webpack config, good default settings.
  
- **Ultimate Hot-Reloading Example**  
  https://github.com/glenjamin/ultimate-hot-reloading-example  
  Demonstrates hot-reloading of pretty much everything, both client-side and server-side
  
- **React Starter Kit**  
  https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit  
  A full-featured universal/isomorphic starter kit, with good documentation
  
- **React Slingshot**  
  https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot  
  A flexible starter kit designed to illustrate best practices.

- **Universal-JS**  
  https://github.com/colinmeinke/universal-js  
  A well-written universal starter with docs explaining choices, and plenty of example tests.

- **React + Electron Boilerplate**  
  https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate  
  Electron application boilerplate based on React, Redux, React Router, Webpack, React Transform HMR for rapid application development

- **React-Redux-Cesium-Testing Demo**  
  https://github.com/markerikson/react-redux-cesium-testing-demo  
  Demonstrates a number of useful bits of project configuration, including offline tests with Mocha+JSDOM, live-reloading tests in the browser using mocha-loader, async loading of React components, use of the Cesium 3D globe library with React and Webpack, and using the Shrinkpack tool to manage dependencies inside the repo.  Not intended for production use, but could serve as a useful example.

- **react-boilerplate**  
  https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate  
  A highly scalable, offline-first foundation for your next project with the best DX and a focus on performance and best practices

- **Koa 2 server with Passport + Mongoose + GraphQL**  
  https://github.com/sibeliusseraphini/koa-passport-mongoose-graphql
  An awesome boilerplate using bleeding edge technologies.
