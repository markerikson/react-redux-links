### Boilerplates and Starter Kits


#### Suggested Starter Kits for Learners

**NOTE**: It's easy for someone new to the React/Redux ecosystem to get confused by some of these boilerplates and starter kits.  Many of them include dozens of specifically-configured libraries, and it can be hard for a learner to understand how all the pieces fit together.  If you're trying to learn React or Redux for the first time, it's suggested that you start with reading tutorials and articles first, until you have a reasonable understanding of how things work.  However, if you _do_ want to use a starter kit as a learning tool, I specifically suggest the ones in this section.  They are simpler, easier to understand, and well documented.  In particular, Create-React-App is highly recommended.

- **Create-React-App**  
  https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app  
  An "official", no-visible-configuration tool to instantly create a React project with bundling, minification, and basic CSS and image handling all set up and ready to go.  If you outgrow the basic features, the underlying tools can be exposed and modified using a one-time "eject" command.  It's a great tool to use to when learning React, or just to set up a project quickly. 

- **Simple Redux Boilerplate**  
  https://github.com/tsaiDavid/simple-redux-boilerplate  
  Excellent example.  Includes enough to be useful, but not too many dependencies so it's confusing.
  
- **Web-App**  
  https://github.com/cesarandreu/web-app  
  Another very good learning resource.  Heavily commented Webpack config, good default settings.
  
- **React Laboratory**  
  https://github.com/tstringer/react-laboratory  
  An absolute bare-minimum project.  One tiny Webpack config, one JS file, one component.  Pretty much the smallest possible setup to use React and JSX with Webpack.
  
- **Hipster Boilerplate**  
  https://github.com/Jordaanm/hipster-boilerplate  
  A learning-oriented repo that builds up a small project config step-by-step.  Each commit adds one new feature or capability (Babel+ES6, Webpack bundling, a small Redux app, LESS styling, routing, and hot-reloading).  
  
- **JavaScript Stack from Scratch**  
  https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-from-scratch  
  This is a minimalistic and straight to the point guide to assembling a JavaScript stack. It teaches you how to set up ES6, Babel, Gulp, ESLint, React, Redux, Webpack, Immutable, Mocha, Chai, Sinon, and Flow. It requires some general programming knowledge, and JavaScript basics. It focuses on wiring all these tools together and giving you the simplest possible example for each tool. You can see this tutorial as a way to write your own boilerplate from scratch.

Not intended for production use, but could serve as a useful example.
